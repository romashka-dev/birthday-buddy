## The development process included the following steps:

**1. Data Import:** An array of objects containing information about people (name, age, and image URL) is used as the initial data source.

**2. State Setup:** The data is integrated into the component using the useState hook for dynamic management.

**3. List Rendering:** The List and Person components display the list of people using the map method.

**4. Clear Button:** Functionality to clear the list by resetting the state has been implemented.
